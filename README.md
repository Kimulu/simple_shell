This repo is all about a basic version of a shell program that can handle commands, execute programs, manage input/output redirection, implement some built-in commands (like cd, exit, pwd), and manage processes by forking and executing programs. This is a joint ALX project by Kennedy Wanyoike and Michael Kimulu.
